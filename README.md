# BrickManager
A tool to manage my LEGO brick collection.

In order to get this code snippet to work, you have to first set BrickLink key/secret pairs in the settings diaglog (Extras > Settings... > Connection).
You can apply for these values on the Bricklink.com site (https://www.bricklink.com/v2/api/register_consumer.page).

Currently supported features:
* All data stored in local SQL database (in memory)
* List your complete inventory
* List your current orders
* List your filed orders
* Get inventory of each order
* Pop-up window to (un)hide columns

This is still a work in progress... many features still need to be implemented.

Good luck!
